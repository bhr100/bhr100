Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here you will find solutions, experiments, snippets and everything related to techonology (specially on data). Some of the projects I share here are part of my continuous learning journey. My profession is data science and analysis, but I'm also a self-learner. It would be impossible for me not to learn something new every single day, I love sharing my experience with others and helping them. Feel free to share, comment, provide feedback and interact with me.
